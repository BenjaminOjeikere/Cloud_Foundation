# Working Backward from the Goal: Identifying Milestones

**Milestone 1: Understanding AWS Networking Basics**
Objective: Gain foundational knowledge of AWS networking concepts.

**Tasks:**
Study Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) fundamentals.
Learn about subnets, CIDR blocks, and IP addressing.
Understand the role of Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, and VPN connections.

**Resources:**
AWS Documentation on VPCs.
AWS re/Start course materials on networking.
AWS Whitepapers on Networking.

**Milestone 2: Designing a VPC Architecture**
Objective: Learn how to design a scalable and secure VPC architecture.

**Tasks:**

Practice designing a VPC with multiple subnets (public and private).
Determine appropriate CIDR ranges for subnets.
Decide on the placement of resources (e.g., EC2 instances) within subnets.
Resources:
AWS Architecture Center.
Online labs or practice scenarios.
AWS re/Start labs on VPC design.

**Milestone 3: Configuring Route Tables and Gateways**
Objective: Set up routing and gateways to manage traffic within and outside the VPC.

**Tasks:**

Create and associate route tables with subnets.
Configure routes to direct traffic to the Internet Gateway for public subnets.
Set up a NAT Gateway for private subnets.
Resources:
AWS Console and CLI for hands-on practice.
Tutorials on configuring route tables and gateways.

**Milestone 4: Implementing Security Groups and Network ACLs**
Objective: Secure the VPC using security groups and network ACLs.

**Tasks:**

Create and configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Implement Network ACLs to provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.
Test the configurations by launching instances and checking connectivity.
Resources:
AWS Documentation on Security Groups and Network ACLs.
AWS re/Start labs on security configurations.
AWS Well-Architected Framework for security best practices.

**Milestone 5: Deploying Resources and Testing the Network**
Objective: Deploy resources within the VPC and test the configuration.

**Tasks:**

Launch EC2 instances in both public and private subnets.
Test connectivity between instances in different subnets.
Verify internet access for public instances and internal-only access for private instances.
Resources:
AWS Console for deployment.
Network testing tools (e.g., ping, traceroute).
Troubleshooting guides from AWS.
